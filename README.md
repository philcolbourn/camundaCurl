Deploy process model with html forms using curl

Camunda Modeler (as of March 2021) can not deploy custom html forms for use in UserTasks.

Limitations
1. manually edit a bash file containing curl commands
2. assumes bpmn and html files are in current directory.

Sample bpmn and form files to enjoy.
